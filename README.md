# Arnav Akula 
# Current
I started my masters degree in Spring 2021 and about to finish my masters in May 2022 in Applied Computer Science.
# Background
I am from Warangal, a town in Telangana, a southern state of India. After completion of my Bachelor's, I started my Master's, so I don't have any prior experience in the IT field. I am fond of watching movies & playing cricket.
# Plans
I am looking forward to working as a software engineer, especially as a Backend Engineer.
